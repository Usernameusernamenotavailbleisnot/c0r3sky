## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   cd c0r3sky
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

The application requires two configuration files:

1. `pk.txt` - Contains Ethereum private keys (one per line)
2. `proxy.txt` - Contains proxy URLs (one per line)

### Private Keys Format

Each line in `pk.txt` should contain one private key:

```
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

### Proxy Format

Each line in `proxy.txt` should contain one proxy URL:

```
http://username:password@host:port
http://username:password@host:port
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The number of private keys should match the number of proxies, as they will be paired in order.

## Usage

Start the application:

```
npm start
```

Or run it directly:

```
node index.js
```

The application will:
1. Start the check-in process for all configured accounts
2. Display colorized logs in the console
3. Save detailed logs to `c0r3sky.log`
4. Automatically schedule the next run in 24.5 hours

## Logging

The application uses Winston for logging with two outputs:
- Console (with colorized output)
- File (`c0r3sky.log`)

Log entries include timestamps and color-coded messages based on the content.
